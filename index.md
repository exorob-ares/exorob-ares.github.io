## ARES Exoskelegon

ARES is a project that proposes the development and distribution of a lower limb robotic exoskeleton. The ARES exoskeleton was born with the purpose of giving users with various disabilities the opportunity to regain their mobility, improve their quality of life and increase their autonomy. Specifically, the exoskeleton has been designed to be able to fit a patient's leg in order to allow and facilitate movement.

### First ARES Exoskeleton prototype

The ARES exoskeleton can be adjusted to different anthropometric measurements thanks to its adaptable design. It presents an extension angle of the knee joint that is adjustable, allowing the full range of movements of the knee joint and being able to limit it depending on the characteristics of the patient. 

The ARES exoskeleton is open source and it includes the guidance and control using ROS (Robot Operating System).
